Use this short break to stand up, stretch, or grab a drink.\n3. **Batch Similar Tasks:** Grouping similar activities like organizing files and cooking together minimizes context switching and maximizes efficiency.  This approach prevents mental fatigue from jumping between vastly different tasks.\n"

Use them to stretch, grab a healthy snack, or simply clear your head to maintain focus and prevent burnout.\n2. **Timeboxing is Key:**  Sticking to your allocated time for each task will help you stay on track and avoid getting bogged down.  If a task takes longer, reassess its scope for the next day.\n3. **Mindful Transitions:** Before switching tasks, take a few deep breaths to mentally detach from the previous activity and focus on the next. This will increase efficiency and reduce mental fatigue.\n"
